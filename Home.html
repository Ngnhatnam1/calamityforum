        <p style="margin: 0% 20% 0 20%;">Welcome to the Calamity Mod Review<br>
            The <i><b style="color: red;">Calamity Mod</b></i>  is a large content mod for Terraria which adds many hours of endgame content and dozens of enemies
             and bosses dispersed throughout the vanilla game's progression. The Calamity Mod also features several 
             harder difficulty modes, five new biomes and new structures, a new class, more than forty new songs, over fifty recipes 
             for previously uncraftable vanilla items and other assorted changes to vanilla gameplay.

        <p class="p1">The <i><b style="color: red;">Calamity Mod</b></i> is a large content mod for <i style="color: greenyellow;">Terraria</i> which adds

        <h4> GREETINGS TERRARIANS</h4>
        <p class="p2">The <i><b style="color: red;">Calamity Mod</b></i> is slowly but surely getting frequent updates in the absence of consistent content 
            from the Terraria team. With smaller content patches coming for vanilla <i style="color: greenyellow;">Terraria</i> , 
            there's no doubt that <i><b style="color: red;">Calamity</b></i> is the place to be if you're looking for exciting new things. 
            Thanks to the shifting nature of a regularly updated game, though, <i><b style="color: red;">Calamity Mod</b></i> is significantly different 
            from how it was even a year ago: items, bosses, and features have not only been added but also removed to achieve a healthier game balance and 
            improve the flow of progression.</p>

                <p>
                    There are so many structures to find and explore, each with its own secrets to uncover. A set of structures known as labs even unlock powerful 
                    weapons that run on energy cells, trading off infinite usage for huge damage between recharges.

                <p>  The <i><b style="color: red;">Calamity Mod</b></i> adds a number of weapons for players to use. Many are upgrades
                      to existing weapons and others are wholly unique. Despite being very frequent within the mod, weapons are recommended
                      getting better ones throughout progression to achieve more efficient battle in fighting bosses.

                    <i><b style="color: red;">Calamity</b></i> is your mod. These bosses put even the hardest bosses in the base game to shame.

            Biomes
        </h2>
        <p class="title-biomes">
            Even though Terraria 1.4 added some new biomes to the base game, the <i><b style="color: red;">Calamity Mod</b></i> goes
            a step further by adding five biomes waiting to be explored.
        </p>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>The Sunken Sea, a peaceful underwater biome, is found underneath the Underground Desert.</li>
            <li>The Sulfurous Sea replaces the Ocean biome on the Dungeon-side of the map; though dangerous
                 thanks to its acidic waters, it offers an entrance to the Abyss.
            </li>
            <li>The Abyss is one of the hardest biomes in Terraria's history, as 
                the enemies and water pressure will quickly kill an unprepared player.
            </li>
            <li>The Brimstone Crag is a hostile biome found on one of the extreme ends of the 
                Underworld, chock-full of biome-specific resources like Charred Ore.
            </li>
            <li>The Astral Infection spawns once the Wall of Flesh is defeated, spreading 
                like a world evil and spawning enemies just as terrifying.

        <div class="mech-context">
            <p>If you decide to play <i><b style="color: red;">Calamity</b></i> on its harder difficulties (Revengeance, Death), not all the changes are made to your detriment. 
                In Revengeance mode and above, you can access two new powerful stats called Adrenaline and Rage.
            The Rage bar grows whenever you're near an enemy and can be activated when full, giving you a damage boost 
                for a short period as the bar drains. The Adrenaline bar exists in a similar niche for bosses, filling up as long as 
                you avoid getting hit and giving you a large boost to damage when activated. Properly using these bars can mean 
                the difference between victory and defeat against <i><b style="color: red;">Calamity's</b></i> hardest bosses.

        <h2><b style="color: yellow;">LORE AND STORY BEHIND THEM</b></h2>
        <div class="lore-context">
            <p>The <i><b style="color: red;">Calamity</b></i> lore is simply the story of the world, told to us, as of right now, by Yharim, a prominent figure of the modâ€™s story that 
                we will dive into. Several times, the <i><b style="color: red;">Calamity</b></i> lore has been rewritten to gradually become a more cohesive narrative, but as of recent Update 
                the Developers have integrated into the game what they consider to be the definitive version of the story, and that it will not be changed in the future.
                That said, the lore is still subject to change. As such, this does not mean it will contain every detail of the story, as much of it is still shrouded
                in mystery. As of now, we have the outline of the story, the names of the main figures, and the core elements that will be expanded upon in the future.
                You could be left with some confusion as to some aspects.<br><br>

                With that said, almost everything else that is in the game is canon, that is, exists within the story of <i><b style="color: red;">Calamity</b></i>. If you see anything in the website
                that does not match what is ingame, then either it has not been updated yet. Of course, however, the developers are only human, and some outdated
                information may be still left in the game. If you see something that directly conflicts with the <i><b style="color: red;">Calamity</b></i> lore, then please, bring this up in the 
                Lore Discussion channel (Forum). As for this information, if anything is outdated I ask you to tell us about it, preferably DMs on Discord.
