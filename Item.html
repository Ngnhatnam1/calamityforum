                            by the Profaned Guardians. When equipped, it increases melee damage, true melee damage and melee 
                            speed depending on how close the player is to an enemy, with a maximum boost of +20%. The bonuses

                            Dragon of Rebirth. When equipped, it gives the player 30 defense and increases movement speed and all 
                            damage by 15%. The player also occasionally leaves behind exploding dragon dust while moving. The exploding

                            on hit. When invincibility is active (i.e. when the player is damaged, enters the world or uses the Magic Mirror), 
                            flaming meteors will fall from the sky. The meteors have a base damage of 375.

                        <p style="text-align: left;">The Asgardian Aegis is a craftable post-Moon Lord accessory with a wide array of defensive effects. 
                            It grants 20 defense, immunity to knockback and the majority of debuffs, including God Slayer Inferno.<br><br>

                            While equipped, the wearer can double tap a horizontal movement key to perform a supreme cosmic inferno dash with a base distance of 28 blocks. 
                            Striking enemies during the shield dash will heavily damage them, inflict God Slayer 
                            Inferno, and spawn god slayer explosions on top of them. Every time an enemy is struck, 
                            the wearer is given 12 immunity frames.

                            It grants 6 defense and 2 life regen. While any debuffs are active, the player's defense and life regen will increase by an additional 16 and 4 respectively
                             (for a total of 22 defense and 6 life regen), and minimum natural life regen will be raised. If the player has multiple debuffs, each additional one grants 
                             5 defense. As the player loses debuffs, the defense granted by debuffs will gradually decrease at a rate of one defense per second. Additionally, it negates 
                             the effects of the Astral Infection debuff, while still counting towards being debuffed.

                        <p class="the-absorber-right-p" style="text-align: left;">The Absorber is a craftable Hardmode accessory. When equipped, it grants the effects of all its component 
                            accessories, along with the added effect of healing the player for 5% of the damage from incoming attacks and grants the player immunity to knockback. When consuming 
                            Healing Potions, the player will summon a green aura which lingers for 30 seconds. Entering the aura spawned by The Absorber will grant players +6 life regen, 8% increased 
                            damage, and 5% increased damage reduction for 10 seconds, along with cleansing all debuffs and defense damage. The Absorber Affliction debuff reduces enemy damage reduction 
                            by 20% and deals 200 damage to enemies per second.
                        </p>

                        <p class="the-sponge-right-p" style="text-align: left;">The Sponge is a craftable post-Moon Lord accessory which is the direct upgrade of the Rover Drive. After nine seconds of 
                            equipping the item without taking damage, a barrier covers its user, which grants 30 defense and 10% damage reduction. As the barrier is formed, it builds up to 180 shield 
                            durability at a rate of 30 durability per second. Durability depletes instead of health as the player takes damage equal to the amount of damage taken. Once all 180 shield 
                            durability is depleted, the barrier breaks and all effects are taken away.<br><br>
                            Durability regenerates the same way as it is formed, requiring the player to not take damage for nine seconds, causing it to regenerate at a rate of 30 durability per second. 
                            It can regenerate if the shield is partially or fully damaged, but will immediately be interrupted as the player takes damage.

                            reduces incoming contact damage by 15%, and adds a Nanomachines meter, replacing the Adrenaline Meter in Revengeance Mode or higher. The Nanomachines meter will gradually 
                            charge over time during boss encounters, taking 30 seconds to fill up. When the meter is full, it can be activated, which will cause the player to heal for 360 HP over 
                            two seconds and gain a massive boost to their damage reduction. Getting hit while the meter is charging will not deplete the meter but will cause it to stop charging for 1 second.

                <p>Weapons are essential items used for combat against enemies, bosses, and even other players during PvP games. 
                    Most weapons are crafted at any crafting station, while others can only be found in chests, as enemy/boss drops, 
                    or purchased from NPCs. The Calamity Mod adds a large number of new and unique weapons for players to use. 
                    Many are upgrades to existing weapons and others are wholly unique.</p>

                        <p class="ark-of-the-cosmos-right-p" style="text-align: left;">The Ark of the Cosmos is a craftable post-Moon Lord melee weapon that is the final upgrade 
                            of the Fractured Ark
                            and Broken Biome Blade. It uses a custom swing animation and performs a five-swing combo of a small upwards slash followed by a very wide circular one that shoots 6 homing 
                            eon bolts, repeating the last two swings once, and then following it up with a medium-ranged throw, where the ark will be sent out spinning, following the player's cursor 
                            for a maximum of 2.33 seconds, before coming back to them.<br><br>
                            During the first four swings of the combo, a fast non-homing rending needle projectile will also be shot, and during the final part of the combo, the spinning ark will be 
                            connected to the player by a constellation chain that deals 10% of the weapon's base damage. The rending needle deals 70% of the weapon's base damage, and the 6 eon bolts 
                            will deal the combined amount of 70% of the weapon's base damage (11.66% base damage per bolt). If the player releases the left mouse button right in the middle of the throw 
                            (between 20% and 75% of the way through, indicated by a blip sound alongside a pulse visual effect), the second half of the Ark will be sent out and both scissor blades will 
                            snap together, boosting their damage by 120%, and shooting out 3 more homing eon bolts that deal 10% of the weapon's base damage each.<br><br>
                            Right-clicking with the weapon performs a parry attack that grants the player brief invincibility frames on direct hits and reduce the damage of projectiles. Parrying will 
                            fill up the weapon's charge.<br><br>
                            Its best modifier is Godly. It cannot get modifiers that affect size.

                        <p class="galaxia-right-p" style="text-align: left;">Galaxia is a craftable post-Moon Lord melee weapon that is an upgraded version of the True Biome Blade. It possesses 4 separate 
                            attack modes under the form of constellation-themed upgrades of the True Biome Blade's attunements. By default, it is equipped with the Phoenix's Pride attunement. However if the

                            should be cycled through. Unlike its predecessor, the player can access all of the attunements from anywhere in the world without having to change biomes.<br><br>
                            Unlike the True Biome Blade, Galaxia lacks a secondary attunement slot, but its active attunement will still give Galaxia one of two passive blessings depending on the tropic Galaxia is 
                            attuned to. Its passive effect is indicated by the color of Galaxia's fiery blade, with the Cancer's Blessing being granted when it appears with crimson hues, and the Capricorn's Blessing 
                            being granted when it uses cooler blue tones.<br><br>

                            contact damage in a regular manner. Upon striking an enemy, a medium-sized stationary flame explosion is produced, capable of damaging the target 6 more times, each dealing 5% less damage, 
                            before dissipating. When used with its secondary fire (right-click), the broadsword itself will not deal damage but will instead shoot a fireball that deals 85% of the weapon's damage. The 
                            fireball explodes into 3 flaming sparks on contact with a tile or enemy, dealing 75% of the fireball's damage. The sparks do not pierce and can linger on the ground for 2 seconds before 
                            disappearing. If a spark hits an enemy, it spawns a small flame explosion that deals 75% of the spark's damage.<br><br>

                <p>Armor is a set of equipable defense items that reduce damage taken from enemies and most other damage sources. Armor pieces are equipped by placing them in the armor slots of the player's inventory. Armor can 
                    also be placed in vanity slots to change the player's appearance without affecting stats. Armor pieces are either crafted, purchased from NPCs, or dropped from enemies.</p>

                            Moving with the full set equipped will produce a trail of bright golden sparkles; if all three pieces are visible then the player will also have afterimages.<br>
                            It consists of the Auric Tesla Body Armor and Auric Tesla Cuisses, as well as having five different headpieces suited to each class, 
                            being: the Auric Tesla Royal Helm, Auric Tesla Hooded Facemask, Auric Tesla Wire-Hemmed Visage, Auric Tesla Space Helmet, and 
                            Auric Tesla Plumed Helm. All headpieces provide boosts to the damage output of their respective class.

                            It is arguably the most powerful armor set available in the Calamity Mod, although the wider array of status effects granted by the Auric Tesla armor may make that desirable in some cases. If the full set is 
                            visible (whether equipped or in social slots), the player will have afterimages. If the full set is equipped, the player will leave behind purple dust as they move regardless of any social slot items worn.<br>
                            It consists of a Demonshade Helm, Demonshade Breastplate, and Demonshade Greaves.
