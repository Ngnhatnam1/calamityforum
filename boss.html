        <h1>CALAMITY MOD BOSSES </h1>
        <p>Bosses are very aggressive with harder mode, resilient enemies that offer a substantial challenge to players. 
            Defeating a boss is usually instrumental in advancing the game in some way. 
            Each has its own particular way of being summoned.   </p>

            <p>The <b><i style="color: red;">Calamity Mod</i></b> expands on the number of bosses that can be challenged throughout the game, each featuring unique AI and drops.
                 Most require the use of boss summoning items in order to spawn. The initial defeat of bosses (both vanilla and Calamity) 
                 typically results in some form of change within the world, be it new enemies appearing or a meteor crash, indicated by status 
                 messages to direct players towards the new content. Many also drop Lore items, usually explanations about what they are and
                  why they exist. The mod currently adds twenty-seven new boss encounters.<br><br>
                  P/s: You may not want drop out difficulites, it refers to how challenging the gameplay is. 
                  There are two additional options to difficulty within the Calamity Mod, both of which increase the difficulty 
                  of the game.

                <p>The Slime God is a Pre-Hardmode boss that can be fought anywhere. The boss is comprised of three main parts, 
                    the Crimulan Paladin, the Ebonian Paladin, and the Slime God Core itself. All three will spawn upon the use of 
                    the Overloaded Sludge, regardless of whether the world contains Corruption or Crimson.</p>

                <p>The Slime God encounter is made up of three individual bosses: the Slime God itself and its two paladins. Each has its own 
                    unique behaviors and attacks. As the Slime God Core itself cannot be injured, it is only required to defeat its paladins. 
                    After the paladins are defeated, the Slime God Core will retreat, dropping its loot.

                    An old clan once revered this thing as a paragon upholding the balance of nature. Now its purity is sullied by freshly absorbed muck and grime.
                    The gelatinous being neither knows nor cares for the last surviving clansman.
                    Such tragedy is all too common in worship.
                    Alas, the Slime god is wise enough to be cowardly. Fleeing battles it cannot win when its servants are vanquished.

                     a multitude of projectiles and enemies.

                <p>Cryogen has five phases, each of which has its own attack pattern and AI. It will progress 
                    through these phases as it loses health.
                    Cryogen also spawns with an ice shield which protects it and inflicts contact damage; this shield must be destroyed
                     to directly attack Cryogen and will regenerate 18 seconds after being destroyed.
                    Leaving the Snow biome will cause Cryogen to enrage, almost doubling its speed and acceleration.

                    I assumed that frigid mass was an old construct of his, running amok without its master to shepherd it.
                    Permafrost was an old ally of mine, wielding the prestigious title of Archmage with great renown.
                    His wisdom guided my original conquests, making much of them possible at all.
                    As my crusade evolved and my ambitions grew, he expressed vehement disapproval.
                    Where justice was once seen, tyranny had blinded it. He departed along with the Witch not long after.<br><br>

                    I had seen this monster roaming the night in the past and thought nothing of it.
                    With its technology, it was certainly one of Draedon's creations.
                    But, to think it was housing a clone of the Witch… Detestable.
                    Surely Calamitas would want nothing to do with such a project.
                    I know not how it wields her brimstone magic. Perhaps some day one of us may find answers.<br><br>

                <p>Astrum Aureus is a Hardmode boss, must be summoned using the Astral Chunk in the Astral Infection biome. 
                    Defeating it causes an Astral Infection meteor to fall somewhere in the world.</p>

                <p>When first summoned, Astrum Aureus will be in its recharging phase, indicated by the lack of astral flames.
                     While recharging, Astrum Aureus deals no contact damage and has halved defense and damage reduction.
                      After several seconds, its flames will ignite and it will begin to attack the player, cycling through a 
                      specific attack pattern before re-entering its recharging phase and repeating the attack cycle.
                       The time it spends in its recharging phase decreases as its life decreases. All of its attacks inflict 
                       the Astral Infection debuff.

                    Ever pragmatic, Draedon dispatched this machine to locate and analyze the source of the Astral Infection.
                    While nominally for reconnaissance, the Aureus model is heavily armed and can scale any terrain.
                    It performed admirably, at least until it was assimilated into the Infection.
                    Sapient minds have enough willpower to resist the Infection's call indefinitely.
                    However… even the finest silicon is not beyond its reach. Draedon prefers his creations to serve after all.
                    With this experiment concluded, he will certainly be examining you next. Watch yourself.<br><br>

                <p>The Plaguebringer Goliath behaves similarly to Queen Bee, charging at the player and using a variety of dangerous 
                    attacks. If the player leads The Plaguebringer Goliath out of the Jungle biome, she will enrage, fire more 
                    projectiles, have increased movement speed, and will accelerate faster and faster the longer she charges
                     until she is faster than and ahead of the player. Attacks gain increased damage, speed, and intensity as
                      her health drops.

                    An innocent queen, forced to bear an agonizing existence. This is nothing short of a crime against nature.
                    Without consulting me, Draedon sought to weaponize the already well-organized Jungle bees.
                    When he revealed his finished project, I was enraged. He had ended up enslaving them, it was despicable. Vile even.
                    Draedon cared little for my outrage and returned to his other work without further incident.
                    From that point on, I stopped making requests of Draedon. He had shown me his true colors….
                    In my later days I was far from virtuous. But I would never shackle a creature to fight in my name.
                    That would make me no better than the divine scoundrels I pursued.<br><br>

                <p>Polterghast is a post-Moon Lord boss that can be fought in the Dungeon. While it is optional, 
                    it is highly recommended to fight it before challenging The Devourer of Gods.

                    Defeating Polterghast will provide the player with Ruinous Souls, a material used to craft powerful equipment. 
                    Additionally, minibosses in the Abyss will begin dropping weapons upon its defeat, and the final tier of 
                    the Acid Rain event will become unlocked.</p>

                <p>Polterghast behaves similarly to Plantera, chasing the player quickly while using four long appendages to grapple blocks.
                    In the second phase, however, these appendages will detach and begin firing projectiles independently, 
                    before re-attaching in the final phase as Polterghast summons an unbound clone of itself.
                    If the player travels to the surface, Polterghast will enrage, gaining a speed boost until they return. If they remain on the surface for over 10 seconds, Polterghast will accelerate away and despawn.

                    The further my war dragged on, the further I sank into negligence. This specter is the crux of my failure.<br>
                    I hid behind my excuses, calling them duties. Fighting the gods. Training. Ruling.<br>
                    I had the time and resources to devote. I was simply paralyzed by apathy.<br>
                    The scores of prisoners I kept in the dungeon I claimed perished alongside their jailors.<br>
                    Within those hexed walls, none may know rest. Their souls coalesced into a formless monster.<br>
                    Boiling with rage, wallowing in sorrow, screaming in madness. The amalgamation was uncontrollable.<br>
                    The dragon cult was furious, their leader demanding I put the haunt down myself.<br>
                    I did not answer. I had long since become deaf to the world outside my crusade. Do not fall as I have.<br><br>

                <p>Yharon, Dragon of Rebirth (also known as Yharon, Resplendent Phoenix when his health drops below 55%) is a major boss 
                    fought in the Surface. He is intended to be fought after The Devourer of Gods. The player should be well equipped and
                    prepared before summoning him as the boss is incredibly challenging.<br>

                    Defeating Yharon will provide the player with Yharon Soul Fragments and generate Auric Ore in the world, 
                    granting the player access to one of the highest tiers of equipment.

                <p>Yharon is incredibly fast and deadly, almost always charging the player at high speeds, dealing an extreme 
                    amount of contact damage. Between these charges, he will also perform a plethora of other deadly attacks, 
                    from firing a variety of projectiles to summoning many lingering Flarenadoes and Infernadoes.

                <p>
                    The return of the Age of Dragons, dashed. Just like that, it is but ashes in the wind….<br>
                    Yharon was the last of the Auric Dragons. As a phoenix, his domain of power includes rebirth.<br>
                    The Gods thought him culled with the rest of his kind, but he returned as an egg. Hidden on the Aerie.<br>
                    I was destined to consume his Auric soul when he hatched, and rule forever as God-King.<br><br>

                    <b style="color: yellow;">Destiny is for the weak.</b><br><br>

                    I rejected their whims, and upended their scheme. I was sentenced to execution for treason.<br>
                    Their meek, ingratiated swine cast both Yharon's egg and I into the magma of Hell.<br>
                    The intense heat hideously scarred me, but birthed Yharon anew. He rose, wreathed in fire and saved my life.<br>
                    From that day, our souls were one. He shared with me the tale of Zeratros, and the genocide of his kind.<br>
                    I promised him I would have justice. So the war began, Yharon rallying all as a beacon of hope.<br>
                    Now, that hope is long withered. I am but a husk of the hero I once was, and this is the ultimate proof.<br>
                    Yharon may yet return, as he does, but he… he has bade me farewell.<br><br>

                <p>The Exo Mechs are a group of post-Moon Lord bosses that can be fought simultaneously after defeating Yharon, 
                    Dragon of Rebirth, and intended to be fought around the same time as Supreme Witch, Calamitas. 
                    The battle consists of a passive Draedon along with the four Exo Mechs: XS-01 Artemis, 
                    XS-03 Apollo, XM-05 Thanatos, and XF-09 Ares. They are currently one of the most challenging bosses 
                    in the Calamity Mod.

                    Defeating them will provide the player with Exo Prisms, a crafting material for various endgame equipment.<br><br>

                    Defeating Yharon will provide the player with Yharon Soul Fragments and generate Auric Ore in the world, 
                    granting the player access to one of the highest tiers of equipment.

                <h3 class="boss-flex-left-title">Tooltip</h3>
                <p>The Exo Mechs do not spawn on their own, and require the player to construct The Codebreaker with a 
                    Decryption Computer and an Auric Quantum Cooling Cell. Once constructed, the player can interact 
                    and press the Contact button. The Exo Mechs can be fought in any biome at any time.<br><br>

                    Once summoned, Draedon will allow the player to choose an Exo Mech that will be spawned first.<br><br>

                    What a terrifying marvel of engineering. Draedon's specialty always lay in the machines of war, but these are immaculate.<br>
                    His bold claim that no God can match his work is, however… incorrect. He is not privy to the Traitor almighty.<br>
                    Regardless, from steel and wit alone, he has forged engines of destruction that rival Calamitas.<br>
                    It brings me little comfort to remark that even she, at least has a heart to speak of.<br>
                    Draedon is an amoral monster beyond compare. He is entirely devoid of humanity and compassion.<br>
                    With technology this incomprehensibly advanced, he stands at the precipice of apotheosis.<br>
                    He can fabricate such dreadful, synthetic nightmares at will. His resources must be nigh unlimited.<br>
                    Were he to lose his temper: if he even has one, all of life's hopes would be smothered in an instant, silenced by a torrent of silicon.<br>
                    Though, perhaps you may leverage his unimaginable craft to your advantage, and seek insight from him.<br><br>

                    Defeating her will cause her to move in as the Brimstone Witch Town NPC, granting players access to the

                    The Ceremonial Urn is reusable, so Supreme Witch, Calamitas may be summoned any number of times.

                    None have borne the brunt of misfortune quite like the Brimstone Witch, Calamitas.<br>
                    When I first saw her, she was still a girl. Prostrated in my court, garbed in charred rags as she trembled.<br>
                    I could not grasp the unfathomable, raw power of the fell magics that coursed through her.<br>
                    She could scant control it herself. Permafrost recognized this immediately. With a pained face, he counseled me to look after her.<br>
                    The Witch entered his tutelage, and soon after my service. She was ablaze with desire to douse the Gods in her wicked wrath.<br>
                    Indeed, the faithful already quaked in her presence. Her name was a moniker of theirs, one uttered quietly in fear.<br>
                    In my campaigns, I counted on her sheer capacity for annihilation as my ace in the hole.<br>
                    No man: army, city or God could stand against her unbridled fury.<br>
                    Eventually, the girl's horrific sin was too much for her to bear. She left my side along with her mentor.<br>
                    The weight of her deeds haunts her to this day. She despises me, and I cannot blame her.<br>
                    Please, if you would... show her respect where I did not.<br><br>
